= Kubernetes Resources for installing the 3scale API Management artifacts for a FHIR Server
:numbered:

== Overview

The following Customer Resources (CR) are defined

. `fhir-backend`: 3scale `Backend` for the FHIR server, the internal service. It could have definied the mapping rules, and methods and metrics, but this is defined in the `Product`
. `fhir-product`: 3scale Frontend `Product` for the FHIR server, the public facing API. It defines the application plans, mapping rules, methods and metrics, apicast policies, and OIDC authentication.
. `fhir-developer-account`: 3scale `DeveloperAccount`
. `fhir-developer-user`: 3scale `DeveloperUser` that includes credentials and info for `DeveloperAccount`. References `fhir-devuser-secret`

The following components are not working yet

. `fhir-developer-account-application`: This is supposed to associate the `DeveloperAccount` with a frontend `Product` and a `Product` application plan. However, the `capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1` `Application` CR is not yet available in 3scale 2.12

. `fhir-active-doc`: Active Doc to represent FHIR openapi spec.
